# Morse-Code-Communicator
This project implements a Morse code communication system on the BASYS 3 FPGA development board. Morse code, historically used in telecommunication, encodes characters as sequences of dots and dashes (or "dits" and "dahs"). The BASYS 3 FPGA is leveraged to encode and decode text messages into Morse
